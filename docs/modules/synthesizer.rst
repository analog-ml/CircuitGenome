Topology Synthesizer
====================

The **Topology Synthesizer (SYN)** constructs op-amp circuits from modular functional
building blocks and emits SPICE netlists.  It models an op-amp as a composition
of **module slots** (input pair, load, tail current, bias, compensation,
amplification/output stage); each slot is filled by a concrete **module
variant**, and :func:`~circuitgenome.synthesizer.synthesizer.enumerate_circuits`
iterates over every valid combination, wiring them together according to a
**topology template**.  Cross-slot *compatibility filters* prune combinations
that are non-functional or electrically invalid, so the enumeration yields only
structurally sound circuits — thousands of them, for dataset generation, design
exploration, or topology studies.

The :doc:`../overview` gives the higher-level tour — the module summary, the
category figures, and the supported-template list with per-template circuit
counts.  This page holds the full detail: the complete variant catalogue, how
the topology templates wire those modules into circuits, the demand-driven bias
construction, the enumeration and compatibility analysis, and the SPICE output
formats.

Parked variants are excluded from the default enumeration but can be opted back
in with ``config={"include_unsupported": True}`` or
``config={"include_infeasible": True}`` (CLI ``--include-infeasible``):

| **†** ``inverter_based_input`` — ``unsupported`` (issue #113): self-biased, so
  its quiescent current is set by W/L at the wiring-pinned gate voltage, not by
  ``spec.ibias``, and the gm/Id sizer has no fixed-Vgs path for it.
| **‡** ``stacked_cascode_current_mirror_tail_{pmos,nmos}`` — ``bias_infeasible``
  (issue #111): the output cascode's source sits a full ``|Vgs|`` from the rail,
  needing ``|Vgs|+Vdsat`` (~1.3 V at gf180) of tail compliance the default
  low-voltage spec class cannot provide. The wiring is valid; only the DC bias
  fails.
| **§** ``differential_ota_second_stage`` — ``unsupported`` (issue #114): despite
  the name it is two cascaded common-source stages, so its ``in`` → ``out``
  composite is non-inverting (Miller compensation around it is positive
  feedback), and its internal node is a second in-band pole the single-gm2
  sizer cannot model.

.. admonition:: Bias generation — constructed, not enumerated
   :class: important

   The ``bias_generation`` slot carries **no enumerated variants**: it is
   *constructed* per combination from what the other slots consume on each bias
   rail — an NMOS master reference on ``ibias`` plus one typed leg per consumed
   rail (rails 1–4 for ``load``, rail 5 for ``second_stage``, rail 6 for
   ``third_stage``, rail 7 for ``tail_current``).  See
   `Demand-driven bias construction`_ below.

Topology templates
------------------

A **topology template** is a wiring blueprint.  It declares the **slots** a
circuit needs — each slot bound to a module *category* under a local *slot
name* — plus a list of **connections**: ``{slot, port, net}`` rules that attach
each module's canonical ports to global nets.  ``enumerate_circuits`` fills
every slot with each compatible variant of its category and stamps the *same*
connection list onto all of them, so one template over *N* variant
combinations yields *N* circuits with identical net structure.  The 13
templates live in ``config/opamp_topologies.yaml``.  The :doc:`Overview
<../overview>` lists every supported template name with its per-template
circuit count.

Signal-flow wiring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every template threads the same trunk from the differential input to the
output; the bias network and (for differential-output loads) the CMFB loop
hang off it as side structures:

.. code-block:: text

   in1/in2 ─▶ input_pair ─▶ load ─▶ [amplification_stage] ─▶ [output_stage] ─▶ out
                  │            │             │                      │
              net_tail   net_loadout*    net_ampout           (final output)
                  │
             tail_current

   bias_generation ─▶ net_bias1..8   (feeds load / stages / tail)
   cmfb ─▶ load.bias_cmfb            (differential-output loads only)

- The **input_pair** converts the differential input into a current, sunk by
  the **tail_current** source on ``net_tail``.
- The **load** turns that current back into a voltage on the first-stage
  output node(s) — a single node in single-ended templates,
  ``net_loadout1``/``net_loadout2`` in fully-differential ones.
- Gain stages follow as needed: a two-stage template adds one
  **amplification_stage** (gm2); a three-stage template adds a second (gm3).
- **compensation** capacitors wrap the gain stage(s) for Miller pole-splitting
  (the nesting differs per scheme — see `Three-stage compensation schemes`_).
- **bias_generation** is the one slot *not* wired variant-by-variant: it is
  constructed per combination and drives the ``net_bias*`` rails (see
  `Demand-driven bias construction`_).
- **cmfb** senses the differential output and drives ``load.bias_cmfb``, present
  only when the load is a differential-output cascode.

Two families of template share this trunk: **plain** and **buffered**.

Plain templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The plain templates take the trunk as far as the gain path goes and tap the
output directly off the last gain stage:

- ``one_stage_opamp`` — input_pair + load + tail only; the load's output node
  *is* the output.
- ``two_stage_opamp_{single_ended,fully_differential}`` — add one gm2
  amplification stage and a Miller compensation capacitor.
- ``three_stage_opamp_{nmc,rnmc}_{single_ended,fully_differential}`` — add
  gm2 + gm3 and two compensation capacitors (nested per scheme).

Fully-differential templates duplicate the per-path slots (``comp_p``/
``comp_n``, ``second_stage_p``/``_n``) and add the ``cmfb`` slot.

Buffered templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **buffered** template is a plain template with a source-follower
**output_stage** slot inserted after the last gain stage (issue #125, PR #134).
The gain stage now drives an internal node ``net_ampout`` instead of the
output, the follower drives the final output, and the Miller compensation is
re-pointed to ``net_ampout`` so it still wraps the *gain* stage, not the
follower.

The design choice worth calling out: a source follower is a **unity-gain
buffer** (A ≈ 1), added for output drive strength and low output impedance, not
for gain.  The sizer's stage taxonomy deliberately keeps ``output_stage`` slots
out of the gain product, so a buffered circuit reports the **same** ``gain_db``
as its unbuffered sibling — buffering changes what the output can drive, not the
small-signal gain figure.  The six buffered templates enumerate alongside their
plain counterparts and reuse every compatibility filter unchanged.

Three-stage compensation schemes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The 3-stage templates reuse the existing ``amplification_stage`` modules for
the second (gm2) and third (gm3) gain stages, and the existing
``compensation`` modules for the two Miller capacitors Cm1/Cm2. The NMC
scheme additionally needs a **non-inverting gm2**, because Cm1 wraps the
gm2+gm3 cascade and pole-splitting Miller feedback is negative only around
an inverting chain — with an inverting gm3, gm2 must be non-inverting. That
role is filled by the ``noninverting_stage_{nmos,pmos}`` variants (issue
#139).

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Scheme
     - Cm1 / Cm2 connections
   * - Nested Miller (NMC)
     - - Cm1 spans gm2+gm3 — gm1's output → final output (the outer loop).
       - Cm2 spans gm3 only — gm2's output → final output (the inner loop).
       - Both capacitors return to the final output node.
   * - Reversed Nested Miller (RNMC)
     - - Cm1 spans gm3 only — gm2's output → final output.
       - Cm2 spans gm2 only — gm1's output → gm2's output, instead of
         returning to the final output.

       Reduces loading on the output node — useful when gm3 is a low-gain
       buffer stage.

Modular interface contract
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each module category defines a **canonical port signature** shared by all its
variants.  The topology template wires ports to global nets by name; the
internal device structure is invisible to the template.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Category
     - Canonical ports
   * - ``input_pair``
     - - ``in1`` / ``in2`` — differential signal inputs.
       - ``out1`` / ``out2`` — differential drain outputs (drive the load's
         folding nodes).
       - ``tail`` — shared source node, sunk by ``tail_current``.
       - ``vdd`` / ``gnd`` — supply rails.
   * - ``load``
     - - ``in1`` / ``in2`` — folding nodes, driven by
         ``input_pair.out1``/``out2``.
       - ``out1`` / ``out2`` — differential output nodes; wired to dedicated
         ``net_loadout1``/``net_loadout2`` in ``fully_differential`` topologies
         (distinct cascode-output devices), or merged back onto ``in1``/``in2``
         via ``alias_of`` for simple resistor/active/current-source loads.
       - ``out`` — single output node; mandatory only for single-output
         cascode loads (wired to the stage's single output node in
         ``single_ended`` topologies), optional/unused otherwise.
       - ``bias1`` / ``bias2`` / ``bias3`` / ``bias_cmfb`` — optional bias
         inputs; each variant declares only as many as it needs.
       - ``vdd`` / ``gnd`` — supply rails.

       Whichever of ``out``/``out1``/``out2`` is mandatory is declared via
       ``output_cardinality: "single" | "differential" | None``, checked
       against the topology's ``output_type`` by the output-cardinality
       compatibility filter.
   * - ``tail_current``
     - - ``out`` — tail node, sources/sinks the input pair's tail current.
       - ``bias`` — mirror bias; current-mirror / cascode-current-mirror
         variants wire it to ``net_bias7``, resistor-tail variants declare it
         ``optional`` and leave it unconnected.
       - ``bias_casc`` — wide-swing cascode-gate level (cascode-current-mirror
         variants only), wired to ``net_bias8``.
       - ``vdd`` / ``gnd`` — supply rails.
   * - ``bias_generation``
     - - ``ibias`` — external master reference current.
       - ``out1``..``out8`` — bias rails, consumed rails only: ``out1``-``out4``
         feed ``load``'s ``bias1``/``bias2``/``bias3``/``bias_cmfb``, ``out5``
         feeds ``second_stage.bias``, ``out6`` feeds ``third_stage.bias``,
         ``out7`` feeds ``tail_current.bias``, ``out8`` feeds
         ``tail_current.bias_casc``.
       - ``vdd`` / ``gnd`` — supply rails.

       The variant is constructed per combination by
       :func:`~circuitgenome.synthesizer.bias_construction.construct_bias_generation`,
       with one typed leg per consumed rail.
   * - ``cmfb``
     - - ``in1`` / ``in2`` — differential sense inputs, wired to
         ``net_loadout1``/``net_loadout2`` (the ``load``'s cascode-output
         nodes).
       - ``vref`` — common-mode reference, wired to the external ``vcm_ref``
         port.
       - ``bias`` — tail-current bias, reuses ``net_bias4`` from
         ``bias_generation.out4``.
       - ``out`` — drives ``load.bias_cmfb`` via ``net_cmfb_out``.
       - ``vdd`` / ``gnd`` — supply rails.

       Two variants: ``resistive_sense_cmfb`` (resistive averager + 5T OTA)
       and ``dda_cmfb`` (differential-difference amplifier). Present only when
       ``load``'s ``output_cardinality`` is ``"differential"`` (see "CMFB
       compatibility filter" below); otherwise pruned to an empty placeholder
       and ``vcm_ref`` is left unconnected.
   * - ``compensation``
     - - ``in`` — stage-input side of the Miller capacitor.
       - ``out`` — stage-output side of the Miller capacitor.
   * - ``amplification_stage``
     - - ``in`` — stage input (gate of the signal device).
       - ``out`` — stage output.
       - ``bias`` — bias rail for the stage's current source.
       - ``vdd`` / ``gnd`` — supply rails.

Supply ports (``vdd``, ``gnd``) are automatically connected to the global
rails ``vdd!`` / ``gnd!`` unless explicitly overridden in the topology
template.

Naming convention
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every template name follows one grammar (PR #143):

.. code-block:: text

   <stages>_stage_opamp[_<comp>][_buffered]_<output>

- ``<stages>`` — ``one`` / ``two`` / ``three``, the number of gain stages.
- ``_stage_opamp`` — the literal token every template carries.
- ``<comp>`` — compensation scheme, present only on 3-stage templates:
  ``nmc`` (nested Miller) or ``rnmc`` (reversed nested Miller).
- ``_buffered`` — present iff the template has a source-follower
  ``output_stage`` (see `Buffered templates`_).
- ``<output>`` — the terminal token, ``single_ended`` or
  ``fully_differential``.

So ``three_stage_opamp_rnmc_buffered_fully_differential`` reads as *3 gain
stages, RNMC compensation, output buffer, differential output*.  The one
exception is ``one_stage_opamp``: with a single stage there is no compensation
and no buffer, and it is inherently single-ended, so it drops the trailing
``<output>`` token entirely.

Enumeration and compatibility
-----------------------------

The ``*_buffered_*`` templates add a source-follower ``output_stage`` after the
amplification stage (`Buffered templates`_ above); they run through every filter
below unchanged, so their combination counts follow directly from the plain
templates' (see the note at the end of this section).

``enumerate_circuits`` aims to emit only circuits worth sizing — ones that both
**build into a valid netlist** and can **plausibly close their DC bias**.  A few
variants are structurally valid but fail one of those; rather than delete them
(the recognizer and design-space exploration still want them) they stay in the
library under a **reason tag** that keeps them out of the default pool but can
be opted back in:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 22 48 30

   * - Tag
     - Marks a variant that…
     - Opt back in with
   * - ``unsupported``
     - builds, but the sizer has no valid path for it (self-biased or
       mis-modeled)
     - ``config={"include_unsupported": True}``
   * - ``bias_infeasible``
     - is functionally correct, but its DC bias will not close under the default
       low-voltage spec class
     - ``config={"include_infeasible": True}`` (CLI ``--include-infeasible``)

**Inverter-based input pair** (``inverter_based_input``, ``unsupported``, issue
#113) — self-biased: its quiescent current is set by W/L at the Vcm-pinned gate
voltage, not by ``spec.ibias``, and the gm/Id sizer has no fixed-Vgs path for
it.

**Differential-OTA second stage** (``differential_ota_second_stage``,
``unsupported``, issue #114) — despite its name it is two cascaded common-source
stages, so its ``in`` → ``out`` composite is *non-inverting*: Miller-family
compensation around it is positive feedback (a right-half-plane response whose
gain/GBW/PM cannot be measured), and its internal ``d1`` node is a second
in-band pole the sizer's single-gm2 model cannot see.  The non-inverting gm2
role that NMC needs is filled instead by the enumerable
``noninverting_stage_{nmos,pmos}`` (issue #139; see the ‖ filter below).

**Stacked-diode cascode tails** (``stacked_cascode_current_mirror_tail_*``,
``bias_infeasible``, issue #111) — the output cascode's source sits a full
``|Vgs|`` from the rail, so the tail needs ``|Vgs|+Vdsat`` (~1.3 V at gf180) of
compliance versus the wide-swing ``cascode_current_mirror_tail_*``'s
``2·Vdsat`` (~0.35 V).  The netlist is valid and sizes normally — it is simply
predicted to fail the DC bias gate, which is exactly the correct-but-infeasible
mutation seed design-space exploration wants.

Number of Combination Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The core first stage is one ``input_pair`` × ``load`` × ``tail_current``
combination.  Successive compatibility filters (marked with symbols and
explained below the tables) narrow the raw combinations to the structurally
valid ones:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 58 18 24

   * - Combinations
     - Count
     - Filter
   * - 4 ``input_pair`` × 14 ``load`` × 6 ``tail_current`` (raw)
     - 336
     - —
   * - compatible PMOS/NMOS polarities
     - 84
     - †
   * - valid for single-ended templates
     - 60
     - ‡
   * - valid for fully-differential templates
     - 48
     - ‡

The ``bias_generation`` slot adds no factor — it is constructed per combination
(see `Demand-driven bias construction`_ below), so every core combination
carries exactly one matched bias generator.  Fully-differential templates
additionally carry a **CMFB** slot: the ¶ filter expands their 48 core
combinations to **72** effective ``load``/``cmfb`` combinations (the 24 with a
differential-cardinality load keep both CMFB variants, the other 24 keep one);
single-ended templates have no CMFB.  A fully-differential template also
duplicates its amplification and compensation slots — one per output path — so
those per-path factors are squared.  Each template's circuit count then follows
from the slots it adds:

.. list-table::

     - 48 → 72 ``load``/``cmfb`` ¶ × (1 gm2 § × 2 gm3 × 9 ``compensation`` ‖)²
     - 23,328

**Compatibility filters** (section-local symbols):

| **†** :ref:`Polarity <compat-polarity>` — drops slot combinations that mix
  PMOS- and NMOS-tagged variants.
| **‡** :ref:`Output-cardinality <compat-output-cardinality>` — single-ended
  templates exclude the 24 differential-only loads (12 differential-output
  cascode + 12 ``current_source_load_*``); fully-differential templates exclude
  the 36 single-output cascode / telescopic loads. The
  :ref:`untapped-load-branch filter <compat-load-branch>` structurally
  co-guards the ``current_source_load_*`` exclusion (issue #112).
| **§** :ref:`Stage-interface <compat-stage-interface>` — the first-stage-sensing
  gain slot (gm2) is limited to the level-reachable ``amplification_stage``
  variants: one CS + one non-inverting stage per input-pair polarity. (The gm3
  slot in a 3-stage template keeps both CS variants.)
| **¶** :ref:`CMFB <compat-cmfb>` — of the 48 fully-differential combinations,
  the 24 with a ``"differential"``-cardinality load keep both CMFB variants
  (24 × 2) while the other 24 collapse to one (24 × 1), giving 72 effective
  ``load``/``cmfb`` combinations.
| **‖** :ref:`Compensation parity <compat-compensation>` — in the 2-stage
  template the single ``compensation`` slot wraps the second stage directly, so
  the non-inverting stage is rejected (positive feedback), leaving one CS stage
  per polarity. The 3-stage NMC scheme's nested ``Cm1`` instead *requires* a
  non-inverting gm2, supplied by the ``noninverting_stage_*`` variants (issue
  #139); before they existed the NMC templates enumerated zero.

.. note::

   ``60`` = 30 PMOS-pair + 30 NMOS-pair combinations.

   A `Buffered templates`_ variant's follower ``output_stage`` slot multiplies
   the base count by its follower variants — **×2** for single-ended (one
   follower slot) and **×4** for fully-differential (one per output path, 2²).
   Both compensation schemes stay identical, exactly as in the base templates:

   | ``two_stage_opamp_buffered_single_ended`` = 180 × 2 = **360**
   | ``two_stage_opamp_buffered_fully_differential`` = 648 × 4 = **2,592**
   | ``three_stage_opamp_{nmc,rnmc}_buffered_single_ended`` = 1,080 × 2 = **2,160**
   | ``three_stage_opamp_{nmc,rnmc}_buffered_fully_differential`` = 23,328 × 4 = **93,312**

   The full per-template table (all 13 templates) is in the
   :doc:`Overview <../overview>`.

Demand-driven bias construction
--------------------------------

The bias generator is not an enumerated module: ``enumerate_circuits``
*constructs* it per combination from what the other slots actually consume on
each of the eight bias rails (``out1``..``out4`` feed
``load.bias1``/``bias2``/``bias3``/``bias_cmfb``, ``out5`` feeds
``second_stage*.bias``, ``out6`` feeds ``third_stage*.bias``, ``out7`` feeds
``tail_current.bias``, ``out8`` feeds ``tail_current.bias_casc``). Each rail is
independent, so the roles never share a bias voltage and are sized separately.

Rail kinds
~~~~~~~~~~

Each consumed rail is classified from its consumer's device connections into a
*kind* that fixes how the rail's bias *leg* is built:

- ``gate_vdd`` / ``gate_gnd`` -- the consumer is a MOSFET gate whose source sits
  on a supply, so the rail must hold a voltage one ``V_GS`` from that supply.
  The leg is an ``ibias``-derived mirror ending in a diode-connected device on
  the rail; that diode doubles as the *master* of its consumers, so the sizer
  sets their currents by W/L ratio rather than by matching voltages.
- ``current_source`` / ``current_sink`` -- the consumer already owns a reference
  diode (a current mirror's own tail diode), so the rail is a *current*
  interface and the leg is a bare mirror with no diode of its own. A second
  diode here would only split or fight the consumer's reference.
- ``cascode_gnd`` / ``cascode_vdd`` -- the consumer is a cascode gate (its source
  sits on an internal node), so the rail must hold its ``V_GS`` plus the
  saturation floor of the stack toward the back supply. The leg is a
  diode-connected device riding a small floor resistor (``out = V_GS + I × R``):
  the diode tracks the large, Vth-dependent ``V_GS`` over process and
  temperature, and the resistor covers the small Vdsat floor.
- ``tunable`` -- no level is structurally implied (conflicting demands on a
  shared rail), so the leg is a mirror into a resistor (``out = I_leg × R``),
  set per rail by the sizer.

The assembled variant (``constructed_bias``) always carries an NMOS master
reference on ``ibias``, adds a PMOS-side reference branch only when a leg needs
it, and emits a port and leg for consumed rails only -- an unconsumed rail
simply does not exist. Rail 4, for instance, gets a leg only when a real
``cmfb`` slot consumes it (``cmfb`` is pruned to an empty placeholder for
non-differential loads; see the :ref:`CMFB compatibility filter <compat-cmfb>`).
The leg templates live in ``config/bias_legs.yaml``; the demand analysis and
assembly in :mod:`circuitgenome.synthesizer.bias_construction`.

SPICE output formats
--------------------

**Flat** — every device inlined in one ``.subckt`` block.  Maximally
portable.

.. code-block:: spice

   .subckt circuit_0001 ibias in1 in2 out vdd! gnd!
   m1_input_pair net_diff1 in1 net_tail net_tail pmos
   m2_input_pair net_mid in2 net_tail net_tail pmos
   r1_load vdd! net_diff1 1k
   r2_load vdd! net_mid 1k
   ...
   .ends

**Hierarchical** — one ``.subckt`` per module variant, top-level uses ``X``
instances.  Shared variants are defined only once.

.. code-block:: spice

   .subckt differential_pair_pmos in1 in2 out1 out2 tail vdd gnd
   m1 out1 in1 tail tail pmos
   m2 out2 in2 tail tail pmos
   .ends

   .subckt circuit_0001 ibias in1 in2 out vdd! gnd!
   Xinput_pair in1 in2 net_diff1 net_mid net_tail vdd! gnd! differential_pair_pmos
   ...
   .ends
